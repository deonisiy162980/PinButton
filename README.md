With this pod you can easily setup and configurate a pin-code style button directly from Interface Builder!

<b>Installation using Cocoa-Pods: </b>

pod 'PinButton', :git => 'https://github.com/deonisiy162980/PinButton'

<b>Usage</b>

1) Click at your pin button in IB
2) At Identify Inspector set the class and module of your button as PinButton
3) Configure some parameters at Attribute Inspector and setup correct <b>tag</b> for your button. So if the button will be "0" then the tag have to be "0". SubText (for example "ABC" for 2 button) will be corrected automaticaly at run time.
4) If you want to configure the <b>gradient color</b> that shows when button is tapped, you can set true for atribute "Show Gradient" and easily configurate begin and end colors. When all is done, set false for "Show Gradient".
5) Enjoy!:)
